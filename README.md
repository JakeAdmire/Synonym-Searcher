# Take Home Challenge

## Overview:

Take Home Challenge is a solo project during MOD-4 of Turing School of Software and Design
- We were given roughly 3 days to complete an MVP

[You can view the deployed application here](https://take-home-thesaurus.herokuapp.com/)

#### Goals for this project were to demonstrate:
- Professional workflow (git branches, commits, waffle board)
- Front-end engineering knowledge learned throughout time at Turing
- The ability to use a concept/library/framework that you have not been taught explicitly at Turing
